## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I focused more on the script. I’m just starting out with JavaScript, so everything is still new to me. I’m really proud that I managed to get the logic working (of course with a little help from Google and some existing solutions to this challenge).

### Continued development

I want to try to dive in with the keyboard navigation with this challenge.
